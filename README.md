# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository includes selected artifacts from two major projects completed in CS 255: System Analysis and Design. These documents demonstrate my ability to collect business requirements from a client and design a system that meets those needs through rigorous analysis and modeling techniques.

- **Project One:** Business Requirements Document
- **Project Two:** System Design Document

Together, these represent the foundation of the DriverPass system: an integrated platform for scheduling driving lessons, managing users, and processing payments.

## ðŸ§  Reflection

### What is the DriverPass project?
DriverPass is an organization that offers online driverâ€™s education and behind-the-wheel training. The client needed a system to simplify lesson scheduling, student-instructor coordination, progress tracking, and secure payment processing. My role was to design a complete solution that supports administrators, students, and instructors with a seamless, user-focused experience.

### What did I do particularly well?
I took great care in designing clean, logically structured UML diagrams that directly supported user stories and system requirements. My activity, sequence, and class diagrams each served to clearly explain workflows, interactions, and data structures. I also refined my documents iteratively based on feedback, which helped me deliver a more complete and professionally polished system.

### What would I revise and how?
If I could go back, Iâ€™d revise the initial use case section in the business requirements document. Early drafts had broad interactions and lacked proper system boundaries. With a more refined understanding of the actors and system responsibilities, I could better isolate functions and define precise use cases that streamline development and stakeholder communication.

### How did I implement the userâ€™s needs into the design?
The entire system design was informed by user scenarios and business needs. For example, scheduling logic was modeled around ease of instructor-student interaction, and payment flow was aligned with secure, real-world gateways. Keeping user needs front and center ensured that each technical choice had a justifiable, functional purposeâ€”especially critical in a project meant for public-facing services.

### How do I approach system design and what strategies will I use moving forward?
I follow a methodical and iterative design process: gather detailed requirements, translate them into UML diagrams, review for consistency, and refine continuously. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate user journey mapping and persona modeling earlier in the process to align designs even more closely with user expectations. Iâ€™ll also continue using structured pseudocode and modeling tools like Lucidchart to maintain clarity and precision across all stages.
